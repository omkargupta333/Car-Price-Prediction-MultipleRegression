Project: Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Introduction:
The Car Price Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on its mileage, number of cylinders, and number of doors. This model can help potential buyers or sellers in estimating the value of a car based on its features, facilitating informed decision-making in the automobile market.

Dataset:

The project utilizes a dataset containing information on various cars, including their mileage, number of cylinders, number of doors, and corresponding prices.
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.
Machine Learning Model:

Multiple Linear Regression is chosen as the machine learning algorithm for this project, as it is suitable for predicting numeric values based on multiple features.
Statsmodels library is used for implementing the regression model.
Steps in the Project:

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into the project, typically in the form of a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Preprocessing: Any missing values or outliers are handled, and the data is cleaned for further analysis.
Feature Selection: Relevant features (Mileage, Cylinder, Doors) are selected for training the model.
Feature Scaling: The features are scaled using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to ensure that they are on the same scale, which improves model performance.
Model Training: The regression model is trained using the scaled features and corresponding car prices.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.
Prediction: The trained model is used to predict the prices of new cars based on their features.
Visualization: The results are visualized through various plots to gain insights into the model's predictions.
Benefits:

Provides an estimated price range for cars based on specific features, aiding buyers and sellers in negotiation.
Helps sellers in setting competitive prices for their cars.
Saves time and effort in manually researching car prices in the market.
Future Scope:

Explore other regression models and compare their performance.
Incorporate additional features like car brand, model year, and optional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
Deploy the model as a web application to make it more accessible to users.
Conclusion:
The Car Price Prediction project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to estimate car prices based on key features. By leveraging regression techniques, this project contributes to the automotive industry by providing valuable insights to both buyers and sellers, ultimately making car transactions more efficient and informed.
